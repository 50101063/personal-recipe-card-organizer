# Personal Recipe Card Organizer

This repository contains the frontend code for the Personal Recipe Card Organizer web application.

## Project Overview
The Personal Recipe Card Organizer is a web application designed to help home cooks and food enthusiasts store, organize, and quickly find their cherished recipes digitally, reducing clutter and making cooking more enjoyable.

## Frontend Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (for initial MVP, with API integration placeholders)

## Features (Frontend)
- User authentication (Login/Register forms - simulated API calls)
- Display a list of personal recipes
- Form for creating/editing recipes
- Basic search by recipe name or ingredient
- Filtering recipes by a single category/tag
- Responsive user interface

## Setup (Frontend - Local Development)
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/50101063/personal-recipe-card-organizer.git
    cd personal-recipe-card-organizer/frontend
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No server is required for the static frontend.

## API Integration (Simulated)
The `script.js` file contains simulated API calls that log actions to the console. These are placeholders and will be replaced with actual API calls to the backend once it is developed.
